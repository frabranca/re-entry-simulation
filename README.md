# Re-Entry Vehicle Dynamics Simulation
This project was originally developed in May 2019, and is now being uploaded to GitHub.

This repository contains the simulation of a re-entry vehicle starting at altitude 325000 ft and landing on the Earth surface. 
This model calculates X and Y position, altitude, speed and deceleration of the vehicle over time.
